		  "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart." - Nelson Mandela 
			<br />
			As a language learner, I am passionate about crossing cultural and linguistic boundaries, and ultimately about making connections.
			This passion fuels my desire to teach English to speaker of other languages. Whatever my students' needs are, I am driven to help them achieve
			their goals. Having recently graduated from the University of Illinois with majors in Economics and Global Studies,
			minors in Portuguese and Spanish, and a total of four terms spent abroad, I am now teaching English to French students in Normandy through France's TAPIF program.
			I am currently looking for more opportunities to teach English and learn more languages abroad.
			In the future, I am planning on continuing my education in linguistics and education, in order to improve my teaching abilities.
			
		   I speak Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan fluently, French intermediately, and German and Italian to varying elementary levels.
			When I'm not in the classroom, you'll find me teaching windsurfing, playing guitar and traveling somewhere new.
