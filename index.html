				As a language learner, I am passionate about crossing cultural and linguistic boundaries, and ultimately about making connections. 
			I recently graduated from the University of Illinois with majors in Economics and Global Studies, 
			minors in Portuguese and Spanish, and a total of four terms spent abroad. 
			I am currently teaching English to French students in Normandy through France's TAPIF program, giving me a chance to improve my French communication skills. 
			I am also currently searching for work that will allow me to put to use my language abilities and my quantitative and qualitative research skills.

		   <p class="ex1 wow fadeInLeft">
			   I speak Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan fluently, French intermediately, and German and Italian to varying elementary levels.
			Outside of work, you'll find me teaching windsurfing, playing guitar and traveling somewhere new.

	      As a language learner, I am passionate about crossing cultural and linguistic boundaries, and ultimately about making connections. 
			In 2019, I graduated from the University of Illinois with majors in Economics and Global Studies, 
			minors in Portuguese and Spanish, and a total of four terms spent abroad. 
			I then spent 7 months teaching English in France as I continued to develop my French language proficiency. When the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted my plans in France,
			  I returned to Chicago and began putting my Portuguese language skills to use as a bilingual commodity futures broker. In August of 2021, 
			  I plan to begin my deferred Fulbright fellowship to Brazil. While teaching English at a Brazilian university,
			  I hope to get involved in linguistics research projects and in designing better technologies
			  for language documentation and revitalization efforts.
			  
			  In the future, I hope to build upon my quantitative and qualitative research experiences and continue employing intercultural communication 
			  to bring beneficial technology and information to people around the world. 
			  This personal website is an informal and ongoing exercise in web development using html, CSS, and javascript. As I 
			  develop skills in user experience research and design, I plan to update this site with portfolio projects and an improved interface.

			  I speak Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan fluently, and have a working proficiency in French. I also speak German and Italian to varying elementary levels.
			 As a language nerd, I look forward to immersing myself in more languages and cultures for the rest of my life. In an effort to expand my linguistic horizons 
			 beyond that of the Indo-European language family, My next language of focus will be Mandarin Chinese.
