		 		 "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart." - Nelson Mandela 
			<br /> <br />
				As a language learner, I am passionate about crossing cultural and linguistic boundaries, and ultimately about making connections. 
			I recently graduated from the University of Illinois with majors in Economics and Global Studies, 
			minors in Portuguese and Spanish, and a total of four terms spent abroad. 
			I am currently teaching English to French students in Normandy through France's TAPIF program, giving me a chance to improve my French communication skills. 
			I am also currently searching for work that will allow me to put to use my language abilities and my quantitative and qualitative research skills.
			<br /> <br />
			   I speak Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan fluently, French intermediately, and German and Italian to varying elementary levels.
			Outside of work, you'll find me teaching windsurfing, playing guitar and traveling somewhere new.
